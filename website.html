		<h2><a href='http://www.regoapp.com/'>Rego</a></h2>
		<img src="images/rego_.jpg">	
		<p>Rego is an app I found that keeps track of the places you have been and is an easy trip planer. It also lets you share
your favorite places with your friends and allows you to give recommendations. I saw they used a lot of maps 
which immediately caught my attention because thats a feature I&rsquo;m using Im my app. It was really helpful for me
to see the way another app laid things out. This app is also very simple and easy too use which is something you
have to keep in mind when designing your app. Comparing it to my app I think mine has more features and while they 
both pertain to different things they still both have a location feature, a sharing with friends feature and a favorites 
feature. I will defiantly take some ideas from Rego. </p>
	

<h2><a href='http://www.weebly.com/'>Weebly</a></h2>
<img src="images/weebly2.jpg">
<p>I came across a web design site called Weebly. This site is really helpful, especially to a new designer because
it guides you step by step in setting up your own website/blog. This website also has apps that let you manage 
and update your website on the go.  It helps you plan, create, publish and grow with simple and easy steps.
As a graphic designer I think this website is every helpful. Its a way to get yourself out there without having 
the hassle of learning how to make a website. This relates to our class because MICA students could use this
site to get organized show their art. The fact that it has links to all social medias is a really good feature as well.
I am always looking for quick and easy ways to get myself out there while still looking professional and Weebly
does just that.</p>

 	Looking at Robyn Morris&rsquo;s work, he has a great combination of graphics, branding and typography.
He also shows his work in an app as well as how they would look on a website. In addition to this
he has a color palette for each post. This is helpful to me as a designer because it gives me many 
different ideas on how to apply colors on my own app. Out of all his work &ldquo;Flavors Me&rdquo; layout is one
of the strongest. The composition is good and the typography is very clean. This app directly relates 
to the work we&rsquo;re doing in class because it deals with apps and websites as well and layout and 
compositions for these apps. Robyn&rsquo;s work is very clean and professional looking in all his work 
and his dribble would be a great place to get fresh ideas.

I came across a dribble account of a young web designer out of Brooklyn. She has done a lot of projects that have gone live and all her work is really clean and professional looking. This is exactly the kind of thing we are doing in class, trying to make a website/ app. Meagan's work offers a lot of insight on what we should be focusing on when designing our website. Everything from color choices, to layout, to typography can be helpful. I like that all her work is simple, it makes the page seem fresh and clean which is something in struggling with.</p>

<h4><a href='http://goodtwin.co/book/eliteform'>Good Twin</a></h4>

<p>

Good twin is a design company that really focuses on the customer and the brand of the company. I really like their site because it’s clean and organized plus navigation is easy. I admire how committed they are to making the customer happy and how they really go the extra mile in getting to know the company they are working with. Their website has some very nice typography as well as a great layout. It’s also successful at being interactive. I think this is a great example to look at when doing my own website just because of the quality of the work. They do mockups of computer screens as well as phones and i pads which I think is a good tool when thinking about layout in my own work.</p>

Looking at this site, I was very impressed with the design and the layout. The first thing you see as very nice, clean black and white photos. Some of work they have done and others of tools they use. They have these photos in a mini slideshow with tasteful transitions which is nice.They have their website set up in a continuos page where you scroll down which is what most of us are attempting to do with our sites. I like that they use very minimal color as well. The only color they use is a reddish color when you hover over certain items or to highlight important information. They also have what looks like a water mark of a blueprint in the background witch I feel ties all the pages together. </p>

Ryan is a profession fashion photographer/film maker. When you first see his website it is very bold and powerful, it draws you in immediately with the big, bold red font on top of the harsh black background. Even though the homepage is powerful its also pretty simple, other then the navigation on the side the rest of the page is black. I think it was cleaver how he has one of his photos filling up the space inside the letters. When you hover over the words on the side the photo disappears and the whole work turns bright red which was a feature I enjoyed. A suggestion for the website would be to figure out a better layout for the photos. Right now it feels very cluttered and takes away from the professional quality of the photos. Also if the navigation wasn’t the same font as the title, I think that would be more appealing.</p>

Michel's website is a perfect example of how to use a website as a portfolio. He has very simple navigation buttons which are just a series of arrows that lead you through his work. He is also very consistent in color and font. He has all his project separated into categories which makes it easy to find what your looking for. The cut off text of those categories does bother me a bit because at the maximum screen size they are not cut off so I feel like he should have accounted for different screen sizes. I think its nice that has has minimal text on his site, I like the big icons that he used as a way of separating his work. I think the text explaining that each category is can be lost because it takes away from the icons.</p>

This is a website that at first glance looks really simple and boring but after a minute you notice there’s a lot more to it then meets the eye.  on the bottom and the left side of the page there are two buttons which light up when you hover over them. These buttons become a side bar and a scroll to view the rest of the site. I think thats a very nice feature that the whole website is hidden by those two buttons. There is also some nice background color transitions throughout the site as well as nice clean cut design and typography. I also like how the show designs they have done on multiple devices.</p>
		
		
		<h4><a href='http://mono-1.com/monoface/main.html'>Monoface</a></h4>
		<img src="images/monoface.jpg">
		<p>Monoface is a really cool interactive website that takes facial features from a ton of people and composts them together to make a new and in many cases weird faces. There are 759,375 possible faces. I really like the playfulness of this site and how you instinctively want to play with it. The way they have their layout is nice too with the navigation bar on the side. The way they transition between pages is also nice and clean. I also like how they have all of their faces displayed along the bottom of one of the pages for the viewer to scroll through.. I think the white background works well in this case because the faces bring so much to the page. Any kind of a busy background would be overwhelming. </p>
		
		
		<h4><a href='http://waterlife.nfb.ca/#/'>Water Life</a></h4>
		<img src="images/waterlife.jpg">
		<p>Water life is one of the more educational interactive sites I’ve seen. They have done a brilliant job of combining visual and audio together. The interactive aspect also draws the viewer in and in turn makes them want to see what they can do on every page. The navigation bar is also very nice. It’s hidden but it didn’t take long to figure out. The fact that they have a video in the back of the text is a nice feature and holds the views interest. Sometimes the music and the voice audio can seem like they are competing but it’s not too bad. I like that when you scroll over the bottom bar you can hear the sound of the ocean moving. There is even a sound on the nav bar which I think is neat.</p>
		
		
		<h4><a href='http://wechoosethemoon.org/'>We Choose the Moon</a></h4>
		<img src="images/apollo.jpg">
				<p>We chose the moon is a really cool interactive site that was created in recognition of the apollo 13 lunar landing. This site allows you to launch the apollo 13 and take the trip with it all the way to the moon. There are many interesting features about this site including a mission tracker which allows you to see the stages of your mission. Photos of the actual apollo 13 and and the astronauts are included and well as an audio feature to really make you feel like your in the rocket. You as  the viewer get to control everything from when you take off to when you come back to earth. Its a very neat experience as well as historical at the same time.</p>
		
		<h4><a href='http://www.intel.com/museumofme/en_US/r/index.htm'>The Museum of Me</a></h4>
		<img src="images/museumofme.jpg">
		<p>This site is one of my favorites. Not only can you interact with it but you can relate to it personally. It accesses you social information through a network like facebook and puts everything from photos to text in an exhibition. It shows all your stuff in a gallery setting and takes you through like your looking at your show. Its amazing from the layout to the background music, it was one of the coolest websites experiences I’ve ever had. I especially like how it uses all the photos it collects from your social media to make a final photo of you at the end.</p>
		
		<h4><a href='http://www.rei1440project.com/'>REI 1440 Project</a></h4>
		<img src="images/rei.jpg">
		<p>REI 1440 project is a site that documents every sing;e minute of the day using photos that are taken outdoors. You have the option to browse through photos people uploaded as well as submit your own. I really like that they are promoting outdoor activity and I also like their layout, it feels like a collage which I enjoy. I’m not sure how I feel about only being able to use the arrow keys to navigate but I appreciate that they prompt you to do so in the beginning. </p>
		
		<h4><a href='http://www.beatboxacademy.ca/'>Beat Box Academy</a></h4>
		<img src="images/drums.jpg">
			<p>Beat box academy is very entertaining and really easy to use which is part of the reason I like it so much. It has four little drums on the first page which all make different beat boing sounds and hitting keys on your keyboard it activates them. I like how they give you a history and some background information after you experience the fun part. The layout is pretty good for the most part, the only section that doesn’t work in the navigation menu. Because the text is white it gets lost in the background in some of the pages and in some cases is not readable at all.</p>
